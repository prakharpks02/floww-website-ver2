                    <p>We reserve the right to refuse returns of any merchandise that does not meet the above return
                        conditions in our sole discretion.</p>

                    <h2>Returning Goods</h2>
                    <p>You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the Goods to Us. You should send the Goods

                    <p>We cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return shipment. Therefore, We
                        recommend an insured and trackable mail service. We are unable to issue a refund without actual
                        receipt of the Goods or proof of received return delivery.</p>
                    <h2>Gifts</h2>
                    <p>If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped directly to you, You'll
                        receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned product is received, a
                        gift certificate will be mailed to You.</p>
                    <p>If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to
                        themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the gift giver.</p>
